# DigiSuraksha — Hackathon Project

**Goal:** Demonstrate common security flaws in government-style apps, show real-world impact, and present a secure "Security‑First" refactor.

This repo contains:
- `govtvault-insecure/` — intentionally insecure frontend (HTTP, hardcoded secrets, localStorage).
- `gotvault-secure/` — secure frontend (HTTPS calls, encrypted storage patterns).
- `govtvault-secure-server/` — demo server(s) for secure and insecure endpoints.
- `docs/` — technical report template, demo storyboard, evidence placeholders.
